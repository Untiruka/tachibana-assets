  {"image": "12.webp", "text": "Tachibana: \"In short, you cut off the stimulus that triggers temptation.\n\nIf it’s smoking, throw away your lighters and ashtrays.\n\nThe brain is weak to environmental changes, so just that alone reduces the frequency of the behavior.\""},

  {"image": "13.webp", "text": "Chibi: \"Exactly.\""},
  {"image": "13.webp", "text": "You: \"‘Exactly’ my ass! Deny it!\""},
  {"image": "14.webp", "text": "Tachibana: \"Second: ‘Reward Substitution.’\""},
  {"image": "14.webp", "text": "Tachibana: \"Replace the pleasure you’d normally get with a different action.\n\nIf you quit sweets, exercise lightly instead to release dopamine.\""},
  {"image": "15.webp", "text": "Chibi: \"In my case, when I feel like beating someone up, I call the police for no reason and then mess with them.\""},
  {"image": "16.webp", "text": "Chibi: \"Then I run away from them—it gives me a dopamine rush and I feel satisfied.\""},
  {"image": "16.webp", "text": "You: \"You’ve got bigger problems than abstinence!\""},
  {"image": "17.webp", "text": "Tachibana: \"Lastly, ‘Implementation Intentions.’\""},
  {"image": "17.webp", "text": "Tachibana: \"If you decide in advance, ‘If situation X happens, I’ll do Y,’ you’re less likely to give in to impulses.\n\nIt’s proven effective in psychology.\""},

  {"image": "18.webp", "text": "Chibi: \"When you’re with us, unpredictable events happen, and your brain’s reward system lights up.\""},
  {"image": "18.webp", "text": "Chibi: \"Especially if it’s close to a **Variable Ratio Schedule**, psychology proves it’s harder to quit until you succeed.\""},
  {"image": "3.webp", "text": "Tachibana: \"In short, abstinence needs variety.\""},
  {"image": "3.webp", "text": "Tachibana: \"Everyone’s too busy with daily life to change their routines, so at least in the app, we can mix things up.\""},
  {"image": "3.webp", "text": "Tachibana: \"Just opening the app and logging isn’t enough… we breathe unpredictable life into it.\""},
